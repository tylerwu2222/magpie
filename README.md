# Magpie: intuitive notetaking
Yes, it's another notetaking app.

# Motivation
I've used a good amount of notetaking apps for the past few years (OneNote, Google Keep, Notion, Obsidian, default notes app...), and each had features I enjoyed, but each lacked some functionality I wanted. I also wanted to get better at full stack, so I thought: 🐦🐦🪨

My goal is to complete a beta by the end of September 2024, and decide from there whether this is worth continuing.


# Features
## Completed features

### Drag and drop gestures 🐉🫳
Quickly execute essential note functions (delete, duplicate, add to group, share) in a *single* gesture, as opposed to multiple unnecessary taps.

### Aging notes 👴
Your notes can age (like Duolingo's app logo), they become greyer with time to let you subtly know which notes
(This feature can also be toggled on a per-note basis)

### Change note view
Change how notes are displayed. (More views to come!)

### Basic features
Adding a note, searching notes, editing notes... not much to say here.

## In-progress features

### Recurring notes (aka a visual todo note)
This idea is similar to Google Keep's daily reminder notes, but with a visual twist: the note will become "emptier" (as if it were filled with a liquid), throughout the day, based on a start and end time you establish. That way, you can get a rough sense of how that task completion is going.

### "Edit mode"
Rather than navigating to a seperate tab to view folders, or have to arduously long press a note --> tap/drag all other notes --> tap a hamburger menu --> move to a folder...
I thought, why not create a dedicated "edit mode" coral 🤠 those notes and establish connections and relationships more easily.

## Potential ideas
### Network-style collections📚
Similar to Obsidian's network visualization, but created manually by literally connecting nodes in edit mode, rather than hyperlinking. This one I'm 50/50 on. Sometimes a note is complex. It doesn't just belong in one category. But also this might add too much complication... still up for debate.
