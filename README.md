# Magpie: intuitive notetaking
Yes, it's another notetaking app. I've used a good amount of notetaking apps for the past few years: OneNote, Google Keep, Notion, Obsidian, etc. and each had features I enjoyed, but each lacked some functionality I wanted. I also wanted to get better at full stack, so I thought: 🐦🐦🪨
~~My goal is to complete a ⭐beta⭐ by the end of **September 2024**, and decide from there whether this is worth continuing.~~

April 2025 Update: I've started a full-time job, but will continue working on this as a hobby project :)

# Releases
The app is currently in alpha for android only. Please email me at [tylerwu2222@gmail.com](mailto:tylerwu2222@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Magpie) if you'd like to join intenral testing.

# Features
## Completed features

### Drag and drop gestures 🐉🫳
Quickly execute essential note functions (delete, duplicate, add to group, share) in a *single* gesture, as opposed to multiple unnecessary taps.

### Aging notes 👴
Your notes can age (like Duolingo's app logo), they become greyer with time to let you subtly know which notes might need some attention (or should be deleted).
(This feature can also be toggled on a per-note basis)

### Basic features
Adding a note, searching notes, editing notes... not much to say here.

## In-progress features

### Recurring notes (aka a more visual todo note)
This idea is similar to Google Keep's daily reminder notes, but with a visual twist: the note will become "emptier" (as if it were filled with a liquid), throughout the day, based on a start and end time you establish. That way, you can get a rough sense of how that task completion is going.

### "Edit mode"
Rather than navigating to a seperate tab to view folders, or have to arduously long press a note --> tap/drag all other notes --> tap a hamburger menu --> move to a folder...
I thought, why not create a dedicated "edit mode" coral 🤠 those notes and establish connections and relationships more easily.

### Basic markdown in notes
think checkboxes, bullet points, underline, bolding, italicizing, etc..

## Potential ideas
### Network-style collections📚
Similar to Obsidian's network visualization, but created manually by literally connecting nodes in edit mode, rather than hyperlinking. This one I'm 50/50 on. Sometimes a note is complex. It doesn't just belong in one category. But also this might add too much complication... still up for debate.
